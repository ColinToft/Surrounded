## Version 0.6 (In Progress)
- Highscore screen
- Teleport mode
- Two-hit mode

## Future Game Modes
### Levelled
- Levels last 30(?) seconds
- Ball spawning rate increases with each level
- When you die you lose 25,000(?) points but restart at the current level
- When you die but don't have enough points to lose, the game is over

### Dodge
- The player cannot shoot, only move around to dodge balls

### Invisible
- The player can only see balls close to them
- Screen is dark except for a visible circle around the player?

### Multiplayer
- 2 players (possibly more)
- Players shoot at each other instead of avoiding computer-spawned balls
- The last player left wins
- Give an option to play against an AI?

## Long-term Goals
- Get coins from winning games (based on score)
- Add additional characters that can be purchased with coins
- Add a character select screen to choose between characters
- Achievements (unlock characters or give coins on completion)
- Tutorial/Instructions (for all game modes)
